Advanced Prompting
There are many Prompt techniques such as zero shot, few shot, chain-of-though, ReAct, etc. Knowing these techniques is important, but I believe there is a more powerful way to develop Prompts specially if you have a development background. When you think of Prompts as application, and transfer your development knowledge, the outcomes may amaze you. 

Inference engines are probabilistic and non-deterministic. This means that the model will try to guess the best next word and that the same output is not guaranteed.
